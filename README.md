## intro

This is my boilerplate when it comes to write small articles.

I make use of the following applications:

* pandoc
* text editor (eg: vim)
* inkscape
* make
* latex

Typically I create a cover svg, using Inkscape, then write some markdown files
and then compile `make all`.

Don't forget to adjust title.txt and metadata.xml!
